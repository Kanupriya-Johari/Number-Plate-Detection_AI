# Number-Plate-Detection_AI
Number plate recognition (NPR) plays a vital role in modern vehicle management systems,
enabling various applications such as traffic monitoring, parking management, and law
enforcement. This project proposes an innovative approach to enhance number plate recognition
using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. By leveraging the capabilities of AI, this system
aims to achieve accurate and efficient identification of vehicle number plates in diverse
real-world scenarios.
The project begins by collecting a large dataset of annotated images of number plates,
encompassing various environmental conditions, license plate designs, and vehicle types. This
dataset is then utilized to train a deep learning model, specifically a convolutional neural network
(CNN), to recognize and extract number plates from images.
By leveraging deep learning and OCR techniques, the proposed system offers a practical solution
for accurate and efficient identification of vehicle number plates, paving the way for advanced
applications in transportation and law enforcement domains.
